🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Graph Theory

A graph-based movie recommender system that uses concepts from Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory instead of traditional machine learning models.

This project models users and movies as a network, where recommendations are generated by exploring graph connectivity and similar taste patterns.

🚀 Project Idea

Most recommendation systems rely heavily on ML.
This system instead uses graph structures to represent relationships between users and movies.

We treat movie preferences as a network problem, where:

Users with similar tastes become connected

Movies are recommended by exploring neighbor nodes in the graph

This makes the system:

Mathematically explainable

Efficient

Perfect for Graph Theory applications

🧠 Core Concept

The system is built as a Bipartite Graph:

Node Type	Represents
User Nodes	Each user in the dataset
Movie Nodes	Each movie
Edges	A connection exists if a user rated a movie ≥ 3

Only positive preferences form edges. This removes noise from dislikes.

🔗 How Recommendations Work

Step 1 — Build the Graph

Create a bipartite graph of Users ↔ Movies

Step 2 — Find Similar Users

Two users are considered similar if they:
Liked the same movies
Share multiple connections

Step 3 — Explore the Network

For a target user:
Find neighboring users
Collect movies liked by them
Remove movies already watched

Step 4 — Recommend

Movies that appear frequently among similar users are recommended

▶ How to Run

1. Install dependencies
  pip install pandas networkx matplotlib

2. Run the graph building script
   python graph_building.py

3. Generate recommendations
   python recommendation.py

📈 Example Recommendation Logic (Simplified)

for neighbor in similar_users:
    for movie in movies_liked_by_neighbor:
        if movie not in target_user_movies:
            score[movie] += 1

Movies with higher scores are recommended.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

✔ Application of Graph Theory in real-world systems
✔ Building recommendation systems without ML
✔ Network modeling of relationships
✔ Data analysis with Python

🔮 Future Improvements

Weighted edges based on rating strength
Community detection for genre clusters
Hybrid model (Graph + ML)
Real-time recommendation interface
