# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Graph Theory

A **graph-based movie recommender system** that uses concepts from **Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory** instead of traditional machine learning models.

This project models users and movies as a **network**, where recommendations are generated by exploring graph connectivity and similar taste patterns.

---

## 🚀 Project Idea

Most recommendation systems rely heavily on ML. This system instead uses **graph structures** to represent relationships between users and movies.

We treat movie preferences as a network problem, where:

- Users with similar tastes become connected  
- Movies are recommended by exploring neighbor nodes in the graph  

This makes the system:

- Mathematically explainable  
- Efficient  
- Perfect for Graph Theory applications

## 🧠 Core Concept

The system is built as a **Bipartite Graph**:

| Node Type   | Represents                                          |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| User Nodes  | Each user in the dataset                            |
| Movie Nodes | Each movie                                          |
| Edges       | A connection exists if a user rated a movie **≥ 3** |

Only positive preferences form edges. This removes noise from dislikes.

## 🔗 How Recommendations Work

### Step 1 — Build the Graph
Create a bipartite graph of **Users ↔ Movies**

### Step 2 — Find Similar Users
Two users are considered similar if they:
- Liked the same movies  
- Share multiple connections  

### Step 3 — Explore the Network
For a target user:
- Find neighboring users  
- Collect movies liked by them  
- Remove movies already watched  

### Step 4 — Recommend
Movies that appear frequently among similar users are recommended.
